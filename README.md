# Tripodmaps Chui Edition
This is a GIS mapviewer that implement the iManagement BI classes in C#.

This edition is known as <b>Chui</b>. Chui is the swahili word for leopard. 

The other edition of Tripodmaps is given the alias <b>Simba</b>. 

The main differences between the two editions is that the .NET controller for displaying maps is different in both edition, and also that the Simba edition will contain a more complete implementation of the iManagement_ERP-BI module than the Chui edition. The Chui Edition uses EasyGISDotNet for the map viewer while Simba edition uses SharpMap as the map viewer control.
